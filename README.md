<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Over a period period of time, many issues have been faced by our students regarding the doubt solving issues. The most difficult situation they face while solving some question and if they got stuck some where & most importantly for guidence. One of them is the huge time taken for calling and asking doubt with others.
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposes a “automate Chat bot” to response the students there doubts and help them in more efficient manner digitally. Its features include responsing and suggestining resources within a sec according to the availability as a mentor . For now this app is build by a beginners and has a basic functionalities . It is hard coded so, for now it is not ready for users . Currently the app works for SSITM institute only.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

- The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students to clear their doubts. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app : 
- Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
- RecyclerView : To present the list of different messages we used the efficient recyclerview.
- Activity life cycle : we can do proper operations at the right time and avoid crashes and other bugs. Navigation of a single screen with a user interface can be done easily.
- Coroutines : A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that  use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Using coroutine we have designed pattern so that it can easily simplify code and executes asynchronously.

The app is currently in the modification & testing phase with SSITM institute with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : [Download](https://github.com/Ayan-thecodeking/myFirstChatApp/releases/tag/v2.3.4).


Once the app is fully tested and functional in SSITM institute, We are looking forward to add more features like artificial intelligence & voice assistent. we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this question solving app . We are working on the updation and on more functionalities so that we can make it more efficient for the students .
